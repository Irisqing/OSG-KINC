OSG BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

Utilize stash2 filesystem to set up and launch workflow.  /stash2/user/<username>
Please use login02 to launch workflow.  

    ssh login02.osgconnect.net

Transfer input ematrix to the task-files/kinc-wrapper/ directory

-------------------------

HOW TO SET UP WORKFLOW:

Input file format:

Tab delimited ematrix
No 'GeneID' string in header.  First value of header is a dataset ID
Number of columns = Number of datasets (can count number of columns in header to get this value)
Number of Rows = Number of rows in file including the header

Example Dataset:

Dataset1	Dataset2	Dataset3
Gene1	1	0	2
Gene2	0	3	5
Gene3	2	2	4
Gene4	11	12	0
Gene5	15	0	3

For this dataset, the kinc parameters would be as follows:

rows: 6
columns: 3 
-----------------

Relevant Files and Directories:

-----------------------

kinc (software executable)
tools/kinc-wrapper (executable shell script)
-----------------------

submit (Script that launches the workflow)
tools/dax-generator (generates dax.xml.)
pegasus.conf   (config file for pegasus.  Same file for every workflow)
------------------------

scratch/    (input and output files are temporarily stored here)
workflows/  (job files are stored here)
outputs/    (Output is transferred here once workflow completes)
------------------------

How to submit the workflow for a new input file called "mynew_matrix.txt" which
is compressed as "mynew_matrix.tar.gz"

1) Copy the *.gz and *.txt files to task-files/kinc-wrapper/

2) ./submit [number of lines]
        - Workflow can take several minutes to launch
        - Warning messages about requesting memory will appear, these are normal:
        [WARNING]  unknown profile condor.request_memory ,  using anyway
        - Once workflow is submitted, a link to the workflow files and example pegasus 
        commands to monitor the workflow will print to screen
